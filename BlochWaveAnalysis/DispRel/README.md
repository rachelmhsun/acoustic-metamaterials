# Plotting Dispersion Relations
"vel_analysis.m" plots participation factor data and individual dispersion relations (with group velocity if desired) for each dispersion relation for a parametric study of a braced cubic unit cell with lumped masses (parameterized to increase in size). 

Data for relative density of 20% with lumped masses at the corner nodes is provided with "BC20_corner_velm.csv"

Data for relative density of 20% for cantilever with a mass extending from a corner node is provided with "BC20_cornerResonator_vel.csv".
